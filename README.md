# Pathfinding Visualizer

### This django web application will visualize different pathfinding algorithms on an interactive.

## Algorithms

### Breadth First Search

### Depth First Search

### Dijkstra's

### Bellman Ford

### Converging Dijkstra Implementation

This implementaton will have two separate Dijkstra's algorithms. One will begin at the starting point and the other will start at the destination. The two algorithms should run simultaneously until they meet a common node. After meeting in the "middle point", the application will display the shortest path from the start vertex to its destination.

The goal is to see if would cut the total runtime in half. Imperial runtime analysis will be used to prove this theory and see if the extra cost in space is worth the speed.
